# Linux Encryption Decryption Lab: Breaking a Caesar Cipher and Using OpenSSL

## Scenario

In this lab, I faced a situation where all the files in my home directory were encrypted. To recover my data, I had to break a Caesar cipher and decrypt the files using Linux commands. This process involved exploring the directory, finding hidden files, solving the cipher, and finally decrypting the encrypted data file.

***Steps***

Task 1: Exploring the Home Directory and Reading a File

List files in the directory:
```bash
ls /home/analyst
```

Q1.encrypted  README.txt caesar
Read the contents of README.txt:
bash

cat README.txt
The file contained instructions advising me to look for a hidden file in the caesar subdirectory.
Task 2: Finding a Hidden File and Decrypting the Caesar Cipher
Change directory to caesar:
bash
Copy code
cd caesar
List all files (including hidden ones):
bash
Copy code
ls -a
Output:

Copy code
.  ..  .leftShift3
Read the hidden .leftShift3 file:
bash
Copy code
cat .leftShift3
Decrypt the Caesar cipher with a left shift of 3:
bash
Copy code
cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"
This revealed the instructions for the next step.
Task 3: Decrypting the Encrypted File
Use the provided openssl command to decrypt the file Q1.encrypted:
bash
Copy code
openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute
Verify the decrypted contents:
bash
Copy code
cat Q1.recovered
Output:

arduino
Copy code
If you are able to read this, then you have successfully decrypted the classic cipher text. You recovered the encryption key that was used to encrypt this file. Great work!
Learnings

Gained hands-on experience with Caesar ciphers and decryption.
Used the tr command in Linux to solve the Caesar cipher.
Used openssl to decrypt an encrypted file using AES-256-CBC encryption.
Reinforced the importance of command-line tools in data recovery and encryption.
