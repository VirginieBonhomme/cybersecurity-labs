# Cybersecurity Incident Report: Analyze Network Layer Communication

## Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst working at a company that specializes in providing IT consultant services. Several customers contacted your company to report that they were not able to access the company website www.yummyrecipesforme.com, and saw the error “destination port unreachable” after waiting for the page to load. 

You are tasked with analyzing the situation and determining which network protocol was affected during this incident. To start, you visit the website and you also receive the error “destination port unreachable.” Next, you load your network analyzer tool, tcpdump, and load the webpage again. This time, you receive a lot of packets in your network analyzer. The analyzer shows that when you send UDP packets and receive an ICMP response returned to your host, the results contain an error message: “udp port 53 unreachable.”

In the DNS and ICMP log, you find the following information:

1. In the first two lines of the log file, you see the initial outgoing request from your computer to the DNS server requesting the IP address of yummyrecipesforme.com. This request is sent in a UDP packet.

2. Next you find timestamps that indicate when the event happened. In the log, this is the first sequence of numbers displayed. For example: 13:24:32.192571. This displays the time 1:24 p.m., 32.192571 seconds.

3. The source and destination IP address is next. In the error log, this information is displayed as: 192.51.100.15.52444 > 203.0.113.2.domain. The IP address to the left of the greater than (>) symbol is the source address. In this example, the source is your computer’s IP address. The IP address to the right of the greater than (>) symbol is the destination IP address. In this case, it is the IP address for the DNS server: 203.0.113.2.domain.

4. The second and third lines of the log show the response to your initial ICMP request packet. In this case, the ICMP 203.0.113.2 line is the start of the error message indicating that the ICMP packet was undeliverable to the port of the DNS server.

5. Next are the protocol and port number, which displays which protocol was used to handle communications and which port it was delivered to. In the error log, this appears as: udp port 53 unreachable. This means that the UDP protocol was used to request a domain name resolution using the address of the DNS server over port 53. Port 53, which aligns to the .domain extension in 203.0.113.2.domain, is a well-known port for DNS service. The word “unreachable” in the message indicates the message did not go through to the DNS server. Your browser was not able to obtain the IP address for yummyrecipesforme.com, which it needs to access the website because no service was listening on the receiving DNS port as indicated by the ICMP error message “udp port 53 unreachable.”

The remaining lines in the log indicate that ICMP packets were sent two more times, but the same delivery error was received both times. 


## Network Analysis Findings

### Client DNS Query Attempts
The UDP protocol analysis reveals that the client device with IP address `192.51.100.15` attempted to resolve the domain `yummyrecipesforme.com` using DNS queries sent to the DNS server at `203.0.113.2` on UDP port 53. The repeated attempts indicate that the client was unable to receive a valid DNS response.

### ICMP Error Message Analysis
Based on the network analysis results, the ICMP echo reply returned the error message: `"UDP port 53 unreachable."` This message indicates that the DNS server at `203.0.113.2` was either not running a DNS service or was misconfigured and unable to handle DNS queries on port 53.

### Port Information
- **Port Noted in the Error Message**:  
  UDP port 53 is used for DNS (Domain Name System) queries and responses. It is essential for resolving domain names to IP addresses.

### Most Likely Issue
The most likely issue is that the DNS service on the server at `203.0.113.2` is not operational or properly configured. This could be due to one of the following reasons:

- The DNS service is down.
- A firewall is blocking the port.
- The DNS server software is not listening on the correct port.

As a result, the server responded with ICMP error messages indicating that the DNS service was unreachable on port 53.


## Incident Report

### Time Incident Occurred
The incident began at `13:24:32` and continued with periodic attempts until at least `13:28:50`, indicating a repeated issue over approximately four minutes.

### How the IT Team Became Aware of the Incident
The IT team was alerted through ICMP error messages received from the DNS server (`203.0.113.2`). These messages indicated that the DNS server was unreachable on UDP port 53, which is crucial for DNS queries.

### Actions Taken by the IT Department to Investigate the Incident

1. **Review of TCPDump Logs**:  
   The team analyzed the logs showing repeated DNS queries from the client (`192.51.100.15`) attempting to resolve the domain `yummyrecipesforme.com`.

2. **Identification of ICMP Messages**:  
   The team noticed several "port unreachable" ICMP responses from the DNS server, indicating a problem with the DNS service on UDP port 53.

3. **DNS Server Check**:  
   The team likely checked the availability and configuration of the DNS server at `203.0.113.2` to verify whether it was active and correctly configured.

### Key Findings of the IT Department's Investigation

- **Affected Port**:  
  UDP port 53 on the DNS server (`203.0.113.2`).

- **Client Details**:  
  The client at IP address `192.51.100.15` repeatedly attempted to query the DNS server.

- **Server Response**:  
  The DNS server responded with ICMP "port unreachable" messages, implying that the DNS service was either down or not listening on port 53.

### Likely Cause of the Incident
The likely cause of the incident is that the DNS server at `203.0.113.2` was either misconfigured or the DNS service was not running, resulting in the server being unable to handle DNS queries on port 53. This misconfiguration or service outage led to the repeated ICMP error messages seen in the logs.
