# Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan

## Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. Recently, the organization experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that compromised the internal network for two hours before it was resolved.

### Incident Overview

During the attack, the organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic was unable to access any network resources. The incident management team responded by:

- Blocking incoming ICMP packets.
- Taking all non-critical network services offline.
- Restoring critical network services.

### Security Investigation Findings

The company’s cybersecurity team investigated the security event and discovered that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the attacker to overwhelm the company’s network, resulting in the DDoS attack.

### Mitigation Actions Implemented

To address this security event, the network security team implemented the following measures:

1. **Firewall Rule Update**:  
   A new firewall rule was added to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets.

2. **Source IP Address Verification**:  
   Implemented source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses in incoming ICMP packets.

3. **Network Monitoring Software**:  
   Deployed network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns.

4. **IDS/IPS System**:  
   Integrated an Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Analysis

To improve the company’s network security, a comprehensive plan will be developed using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The plan will focus on the following core functions:

### 1. Identify

**Objective**: Identify security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to uncover potential gaps in security.

- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify weaknesses.
- Perform asset management to maintain an up-to-date inventory of all hardware and software assets.
- Review access control policies to ensure only authorized personnel have access to critical systems and data.

### 2. Protect

**Objective**: Protect internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools to mitigate cybersecurity threats.

- Implement strict access control policies, including multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Establish and enforce data protection policies to safeguard sensitive information.
- Provide cybersecurity awareness training for all employees to recognize and prevent social engineering attacks.
- Deploy security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and encryption to protect against potential threats.

### 3. Detect

**Objective**: Detect potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.

- Set up advanced monitoring and logging systems to track network and system activities in real time.
- Implement an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to identify suspicious behavior and potential breaches.
- Conduct regular audits of logs and alerts to identify and investigate anomalies promptly.

### 4. Respond

**Objective**: Respond to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process.

- Develop and maintain an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to outline procedures for handling different types of security incidents.
- Establish a communication plan for notifying stakeholders and customers in the event of a breach.
- Perform post-incident reviews to analyze the effectiveness of the response and identify areas for improvement.

### 5. Recover

**Objective**: Recover affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets affected by an incident.

- Develop and test a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) to ensure rapid recovery from disruptions.
- Regularly back up critical data and systems to minimize data loss and downtime.
- Implement lessons learned from incidents to strengthen defenses and improve the overall resilience of the network.

## Conclusion

By following the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), the company can establish a comprehensive security strategy that not only addresses the current vulnerabilities but also proactively prepares for future threats. Regular assessments, continuous monitoring, and an effective incident response plan are essential components of this strategy to ensure the security and availability of the organization’s network and services.
