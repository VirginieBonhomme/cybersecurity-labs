# File and Directory Permissions Lab

In this lab, I focused on securing a directory and its contents by exploring and adjusting file and directory permissions. Managing permissions is crucial for system security to ensure that only authorized users can access, modify, or execute files. Below, Iâ€™ve documented my process, including the commands I used, explanations, and my key takeaways.

## Project Description

The main goals of this lab were:
- Explore the contents of the `projects` directory to identify potential permission vulnerabilities.
- Modify file and directory permissions to remove unauthorized access.
- Understand how to interpret the 10-character permission string with `ls -la`.
- Practice using `chmod` to update permissions based on the principle of least privilege.

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to the `projects` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd projects
