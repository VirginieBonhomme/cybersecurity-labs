# Linux Lab Report: Log and User Data Analysis

## Objective:
In this lab, I performed a series of tasks related to searching and filtering through log files and user data in a Linux environment. The lab required me to obtain specific information from server logs and user data files using commands like `grep`, `ls`, and piping for efficient filtering and reporting.

## Task 1: Search for Error Messages in a Log File

### Objective:
Identify error messages from a server log file.

### Steps:
- **Navigating to the logs directory:**

  I used the `cd` command to navigate to the `/home/analyst/logs` directory.

  - **Filtering for Error Messages**

    I utilized the `grep` command to search for all occurrences of the text string `"error"` in the `server_logs.txt` file. The `grep` command helped to output only the lines in the log file that contained the word `"error"`.

## Task 2: Find Files Containing Specific Strings

**Objective:** Search for user data files that contain specific strings in their filenames.

### Steps:

- **Navigating to the users directory:**

  I used `cd` to navigate to the `/home/analyst/reports/users` directory.
  
- **Finding Files Containing "Q1" in Their Names**

  By piping the output of the `ls` command to `grep`, I filtered the list of files to display only those containing `"Q1"` in their   filenames.

```bash
ls | grep "Q1"
