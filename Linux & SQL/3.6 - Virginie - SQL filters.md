# SQL Lab Project

## Objective

In this SQL lab, I aimed to enhance my proficiency in data retrieval and filtering techniques using SQL. By working through practical tasks involving the log_in_attempts and employees tables, I applied various SQL concepts such as pattern matching with LIKE, filtering based on dates and times, and using logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT to refine query results.

# Task 1: Retrieve After-Hours Failed Login Attempts

Objective: Identify all unsuccessful login attempts that occurred after business hours (after 18:00).

***Query:***
```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE;
```

Explanation:
In this query:

Filtering for Times: I used login_time > '18:00' to select records where the login time is after 6 PM.
Boolean Values: The success column stores TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0. By specifying success = FALSE, I filtered for failed login attempts.
Using AND Operator: The AND operator ensures both conditions must be true for a record to be included.
Answer:
There are 19 failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00.

# Task 2: Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates

Objective: Retrieve all login attempts that occurred on '2022-05-09' and the day before ('2022-05-08').

***Query:***
```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08';
```

Explanation:
In this query:

Filtering for Dates: I compared the login_date column to specific dates using =.
Using OR Operator: The OR operator allows records that meet either condition to be included.
Answer:
There are 75 login attempts on these two days.

# Task 3: Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico

***Objective:*** Find all login attempts that did not originate in Mexico, considering that the country field includes entries like 'MEX' and 'MEXICO'.

***Query:***
```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE NOT country LIKE 'MEX%';
```
Explanation:
In this query:

Using LIKE Operator: The LIKE 'MEX%' pattern matches any country value starting with 'MEX', such as 'MEX' or 'MEXICO'.
Using NOT Operator: The NOT operator negates the condition, so it selects records where the country does not start with 'MEX'.
Wildcards: The % wildcard represents any sequence of characters following 'MEX'.

***Answer:***
There are 144 login attempts made outside of Mexico.

# Task 4: Retrieve Employees in Marketing Located in the East Building

***Objective:*** Obtain information about employees in the 'Marketing' department who are located in all offices in the East building (e.g., 'East-170', 'East-320').

***Query:***
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'East%';
```
***Explanation:***
In this query:

Filtering by Department: department = 'Marketing' selects employees in the Marketing department.
Using LIKE with Wildcards: office LIKE 'East%' matches any office location that starts with 'East'.
Using AND Operator: Ensures that both the department and office conditions must be true.

***Answer:***
The username of the first employee in the Marketing department in the East building is elarson.

# Task 5: Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales

***Objective:*** Retrieve records for employees in the 'Finance' or 'Sales' departments.

Query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';
```

***Explanation:***
In this query:

Filtering by Multiple Departments: I specified both departments using department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales'.
Using OR Operator: Allows inclusion of employees from either the Finance or Sales departments.

Answer:
The username of the first employee in the Sales department is lrodriqu.

# Task 6: Retrieve All Employees Not in IT

***Objective:*** Find all employees who are not in the 'Information Technology' department.

***Query:***
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE NOT department = 'Information Technology';
```

***Explanation:***
In this query:

Using NOT Operator: NOT department = 'Information Technology' excludes employees whose department is 'Information Technology'.
Filtering Exclusions: This method is effective for retrieving records that do not match a specific criterion.
Answer:
There are 161 employees who arenâ€™t in the Information Technology department.

***Summary***

Throughout this lab, I deepened my understanding of SQL querying techniques, particularly in:

Using LIKE for Pattern Matching: Learned how to search for patterns within string data using wildcards (%).
Filtering for Dates and Times: Practiced comparing date and time columns to specific values for precise data retrieval.

Applying Logical Operators:

```AND and OR:``` Used to combine multiple conditions, refining the query results to meet complex criteria.

```NOT:``` Utilized to exclude certain records, allowing for the selection of all data that does not meet a particular condition.

By completing these tasks, I enhanced my ability to construct complex SQL queries, which is essential for effective data analysis and database management.
