# SQL Lab: Investigating Employee Devices and Login Activity

In this lab, we work with the machines and log_in_attempts tables to retrieve relevant data, identifying employee devices that require updates and detecting unusual login patterns.

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to practice SQL queries to:

Identify devices needing updates by retrieving information on email clients, operating systems, and patch dates.

Detect unusual login activity by analyzing login locations and times for suspicious behavior.
This lab focuses on using SELECT and ORDER BY commands to extract, sort, and analyze data efficiently.
